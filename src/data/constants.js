This involved creating a network graph with users as nodes and their shared subreddit memberships as edges, utilizing NetworkX and GraphML to visualize and explore the network’s structure. The analysis incorporated techniques such as degree analysis, degree distribution, path analysis, centrality measures, connected components, clustering coefficients, network density, and network type determination. This multifaceted approach provided deep insights into user interactions, community dynamics, and evolving network structures, enabling both static and dynamic community discovery to better understand user engagement, information flow, and community evolution within the Egyptian Reddit landscape.",
